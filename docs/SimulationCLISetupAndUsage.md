## Introduction

EventSim CLI is an interface or user tool which enables user to interact with rest server. It has dependency on EventSim server, Voltdb, Postgres database and RabbitMQ.

Refer to the **SimulationSetupAndUsage.md** for details.


## Setup and Configuration

After successful build
Install EventSim CLI by running following command.

##### Command: (Navigate to dai-ds directory)

```bash
sudo ./build/distributions/install-cli-eventsim*.sh
```

Navigate to eventsim_cli_config.json fould in /opt/ucs/etc directory

```json
{
  "rest_server_address" : "rest_server_ip_address_or_hostname",
  "rest_server_port" : "rest_server_port"
}
```

In order to get the overall/general help for EventSim CLI. Just type following command. 

```bash
admin@/opt/ucs/bin:~> eventsim
admin@/opt/ucs/bin:~> eventsim --help
```

After executing the above command, user will be able to see help of all UCS subcommands. The example of help is shown below:

### EventSim events subcommand


This subcommand is used to generate different types of events like ras, environmental, boot state change and job events. It also enables user to generate these different events (except job) in a group by using scenario command. 
It helps user to get seed value used to generate events in-order to replicate data.

```bash
user@/opt/ucs/bin:~> eventsim events --help
usage: eventsim events [-h] {ras,sensor,job,boot,scenario,get-seed,echo} ...

positional arguments:
  {ras,sensor,job,boot,scenario,get-seed,echo}
                        subparser for events
    ras                 generate ras events
    sensor              generate sensor events
    job                 generate job events
    boot                generate boot events
    scenario            generate events for a given scenario
    get-seed            fetch prior seed to replicate same data.
    echo                echo json directly to connection

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

### Events subcommand – Scenario

This subcommand is used to generate all types (ras, sensor, boot) events in a group. end-user should configure scenario using the template given below.
Currently, there are 3 modes in scenario. They are
1. burst = given ras/sensor/boot events are sent in groups (events/group-rate) randomly
2. group-burst = given ras/sensor/boot events are sent in groups (specific ras/sensor/boot numbers)
3. repeat = re-run above burst/group-burst mode continuosly either by using counter, duration or start-time.

counter = (how many times scenario should run)

duration = (how long scenario should run accepts in minutes only)

start-time = (schedule to run scenario at a specific time)

### Events subcommand – get-seed

This subcommand is used to fetch prior used seed to generate events.

Events Get-seed Command:
##### user@/opt/ucs/bin:~> eventsim events get-seed --help
```bash
usage: eventsim events get-seed [-h] [--seed SEED] [--timeout TIMEOUT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --seed SEED        seed to duplicate data
  --timeout TIMEOUT  get-seed sub-command execution timeout


Example:
user@/opt/ucs/bin:~> eventsim events get-seed
```

**Note:**

By default, events are sent to network with constant delays between events.
If burst mode is enabled, events are sent to network without any delays between events.

**time delay is configured in EventSim.json file**

### Cobalt Job Simulation

It is possible to generate artificial log entries to simulate Cobalt entries that would perform actions like creating a reservation, modifying a reservation, deleting a reservation, starting a job and terminating a job. This is all done with a simple set of command lines.

### Eventsim Command Line Usage

The eventsim wlm subcommand has the following options:

•	Create Reservation: generate a create reservation log entry

•	Modify Reservation: generate a modify reservation log entry

•	Delete Reservation: generate a delete reservation log entry

•	Start Job: generate a start job log entry

•	Terminate Job: generate a terminate job log entry

•	Simulate: Simulate a series of random job events to simulate real world use case scenarios.


```bash
eventsim wlm --help
usage: eventsim wlm [-h]
                    {create_reservation,modify_reservation,delete_reservation,start_job,terminate_job,simulate}
                    ...

positional arguments:
  {create_reservation,modify_reservation,delete_reservation,start_job,terminate_job,simulate}
                        Subparser for wlm
    create_reservation  generate a log event for a created reservation.
    modify_reservation  generate a log event for a modified reservation.
    delete_reservation  generate a log event for a deleted reservation.

  --name NAME           Name of the started job.
  --users USERS         Users that started job.
  --nodes NODES         Nodes for the job.
  --start-time START_TIME
                        Start time of the job.
  --workdir WORKDIR     Work directory of the job.
  --exit-status EXIT_STATUS
                        Exit status of the job.
```

### WLM Subcommand – Simulate

Generates a specific number of real life use case scenarios of a series of randomized reservation and job events. For example if we set the number of reservations input to 3, we could generate a create reservation, start job, terminate job series; followed by a create reservation, delete reservation series; followed by a create reservation, modify reservation, start job, terminate job series. All job events would happen in order for each series, but randomized between them so you can get events from each of them at different times.

```bash
eventsim wlm simulate --help
usage: eventsim wlm simulate [-h] reservations

positional arguments:
  reservations  Number of reservations to simulate

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
```

### WLM Adapter Configuration Change

To configure the WLM Adapter it is necessary to add the following lines to the MachineConfi.json file located in /opt/ucs/etc:

In the Adapter Instances Section:

```xml
{
  "LogFile": "$UCSLOGFILEDIRECTORY/AdapterWLM-$LCTN-$INSTANCE.log",
  "ServiceNode": “<SERVICE NODE HOSTNAME>”,
  "Invocation": "com.intel.dai.resource_managers.cobalt.AdapterWlmCobalt",
  "TypeOfAdapter": "WLM",
  "NumberOfInstances": 1
}
```
In the Initial Workitems Section:

```xml
{
  "Parms": "RabbitMQHost=<RABBITMQ HOSTNAME>",
  "TypeOfAdapter": "WLM",
  "NotifyWhenFinished": "F",
  "WorkToBeDone": "HandleInputFromExternalComponent",
  "Queue": ""
}
```

## Logstash Configuration

For the log entries to be processed by the WLM Adapter it is necessary to have Logstash properly configured and running. 

First, the files cobalt-bgsched.log and cobalt-cqm.log located in the data/etc-logstash/conf.d directory of the ucs code tree need to be copied to the logstash configuration directory: /etc/logstash/conf.d/

Make sure that both configuration files point to the correct rabbitMQ server. With the default docker deployment, this is sms01-nmn.local.

After this, the logstash service needs to be restarted with the new configuration using the command: systemctl restart logstash
