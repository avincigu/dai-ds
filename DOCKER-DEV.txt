SAMPLE DAI DOCKER CLUSTER
==============================================================================
Folder: ./docker-dev-cluster


Prerequisites:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The host used must have docker and docker-compose installed and running
properly with internet access to use the docker service cluster on a given
host.


Description and Use:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When building DAI, one of the outputs found in the build/distribution folder
is the file:

    dai-docker-dev-<version>.tar.gz

This file when extracted onto a single host, contains everything needed to get
a DAI service cluster up an running including the EventSim server.

There are 2 docker-compose files in the 'docker' folder once extracted. The
default file 'docker-compose.yml' starts up everything including the third
party components such as:
    * RabbitMQ Broker 3.7.x
    * PostgreSQL 11.4.x (With persistent storage in docker/data/pgdata)
    * VoltDB Community Edition 9.0

The other docker compose services started are:
    * Populating the VoltDB with initial schema and data (exits when finished)
    * A management or parent service node called 'smw'.
    * 3 sub-management or child service nodes called 'submn1', 'submn2', and
      'submn3'.
    * The EventSim server used to simulate a Foreign REST API with SSE based
      eventing.

The second file 'docker-compose-third-party-only.yml' only starts the third
party services and executes the container to populate the VoltDB initial data.
This could be used to run DAI on a real host but have the third party
components run in docker.

All of the third party containers and EventSim container expose the relevant
ports to the host.
    * RabbitMQ
        + 15672/tcp - management port
        + 5672/tcp  - pub/sub port
    * VoltDB Community Edition
        + 21212/tcp - Client port
        + 3021/tcp  - Internal server port
        + 5555/tcp  - Replication port
        + 8080/tcp  - Web interface
    * PostgresSQL
        + 5432/tcp - Client port
    * EventSim
        + 5678/tcp - CLI REST access port

The external ports can be changed if there is a port conflict with the host by
changing the docker-compose files.   The first number in the number pairs
under the 'ports:' sections is the host port.

Each of the containers smw and submn[1-3] launch the DaiManager and the actual
DAI adapters launched are determined by the MachineConfig.json file loaded
into the VoltDB at docker cluster startup.

Once the cluster is running the EventSim CLI can be installed on the host and
used to generate telemetry, events, or boot state changes for testing.


Launching the Docker Cluster:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Change directory to <repo_root>/docker/
2. execute: docker-compose up -d
    NOTE: -d runs the cluster in the background, leaving it off the command
          will block the shell. Use Ctrl+C to exit.
